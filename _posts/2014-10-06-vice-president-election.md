As the new semester begins, we are establishing our new chapter committee. First, we would like to say "<b>Thank you!</b>" to the previous chapter committee members, Zhanni, Jena, and Min, for their continous and significant contribution to our local chapter! It was such a wonderful time to have you guys on board and serve the best to make our chapter better. Great job guys for the past year! We wish you a great future in your next big step!

Now, we decide to running an election for the Vice-Chair of our chapter. Anyone interested please email Zhanni by Oct 6 and we will run the election on Oct 8 after the seminar.
